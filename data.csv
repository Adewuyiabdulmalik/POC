0,Article,Pregnancy,"Before you can take care of your new baby, you need to take care of yourself and your unborn child. There’s a lot of advice out there. Much of it is common sense, but some things – like avoiding cat litter – might be news. Your first tip: As soon as you suspect you’re pregnant, see your doctor and visit Pregnancy and Childbirth at UC San Diego Health.Take a prenatal vitamin Exercise regularly Write a birth plan Educate yourself Change your chores (avoid harsh or toxic cleaners, heavy lifting) Track your weight gain (normal weight gain is 25-35 pounds) Get comfortable shoes Eat folate-rich foods (lentils, asparagus, oranges, fortified cereals) Eat calcium-rich foods (dairy, canned fish, soy) Eat more fish (except those high in mercury) Eat foods with fiber Don’t eat soft cheeses (unpasteurized styles like Brie and feta may contain bacteria that can cause fever, miscarriage or pregnancy complications) Eat your veggies Eat five or six well-balanced meals each day But don’t overeat.

1,Article,Physical Fitness,"Congratulations on taking a forward step to get in shape and feel great. Many people are guilty of wishing they could get a sculpted body from eating junk food and watching TV all day. But that is just not going to happen. Even though getting in shape sounds like a long, time-wasting process, the effort put towards being in shape has many positive effects. If you want to start your journey to having a better body to feel great, here are some tips: 1. Exercise Daily Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding. 2. Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the digestive system clean and running. 3. Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is used toward your exercise. 4. Be Sure to Get Sleep Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique will involve more physical exercise than calories you ingest. 5. Stay Motivated Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night. An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive, you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted."
2,Article,Diet,"These 8 practical tips cover the basics of healthy eating and can help you make healthier choices.The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).Most adults in the UK are eating more calories than they need and should eat fewer calories. 1. Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydratesStarchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta. 2. Eat lots of fruit and vegIt's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth. 3. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fishFish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. Oily fish include:salmontroutherringsardinespilchardsmackerelNon-oily fish include:haddockplaicecoleycodtunaskatehakeYou can choose from fresh, frozen and canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can be high in salt.Most people should be eating more fish, but there are recommended limits for some types of fish.Find out more about fish and shellfish 4. Cut down on saturated fat and sugarSaturated fatYou need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5.Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:fatty cuts of meatsausagesbutterhard cheesecreamcakesbiscuitslardpiesTry to cut down on your saturated fat intake and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.SugarRegularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies.This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.Many packaged foods and drinks contain surprisingly high amounts of free sugars.Free sugars are found in many foods, such as:sugary fizzy drinkssugary breakfast cerealscakesbiscuitspastries and puddingssweets and chocolatealcoholic drinksFood labels can help. Use them to check how much sugar foods contain.More than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g means the food is high in sugar, while 5g of total sugars or less per 100g means the food is low in sugar.Get tips on cutting down on sugar in your diet 5. Eat less salt: no more than 6g a day for adultsEating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much.About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.Use food labels to help you cut down. More than 1.5g of salt per 100g means the food is high in salt.Adults and children aged 11 and over should eat no more than 6g of salt (about a teaspoonful) a day. Younger children should have even less.Get tips on cutting down on salt in your diet 6. Get active and be a healthy weightAs well as eating healthily, regular exercise may help reduce your risk of getting serious health conditions. It's also important for your overall health and wellbeing.Read more about the benefits of exercise and physical activity guidelines for adults.Being overweight or obese can lead to health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease and stroke.

Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help you maintain a healthy weight.Check whether you're a healthy weight by using the BMI healthy weight calculator.Start the NHS weight loss plan, a 12-week weight loss guide that combines advice on healthier eating and physical activity.If you're underweight, see underweight adults. If you're worried about your weight, ask your GP or a dietitian for advice. 7. Do not get thirstyYou need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat. All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, are healthier choices. Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar.Your combined total of drinks from fruit juice, vegetable juice and smoothies should not be more than 150ml a day, which is a small glass.Remember to drink more fluids during hot weather or while exercising. 8. Do not skip breakfastSome people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight.But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health.A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.

3,Article,Old Age,"Ten Steps to Healthy, Happy Aging. Getting older doesn't necessarily mean you'll have a slew of medical conditions or poor quality of life, but it’s important to know what’s normal for your body as you age and what is not.Maintaining friendships and being socially active are important parts of healthy, happy aging   older involves changes in all realms of life, from the physical to the mental to the social, emotional, sexual, and more. Some of these changes you may regard as positive and some negative. The challenge is to maximize the good parts of getting older while taking proactive steps to maintain your health and minimize the negative aspects.What’s Normal When It Comes to Aging (and What’s Not)?Knowing what mental and physical changes normally occur with age is the first step toward protecting your health. Here are some of the more common bodily changes you can expect:Your Bones Bones become thinner and more brittle with age as they lose mass, or density, according to Medline Plus, sometimes resulting in osteoporosis. Low bone mass raises your risk of broken bones, including in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), which can cause a stooped posture and loss of height. While low bone mass and osteoporosis are more common in women, they can occur in men, too. Be sure to talk with your physician about what you can do to prevent osteoporosis. Oftentimes, the first sign you have it is a broken bone.Your Heart As you age, your large arteries become stiffer, a condition called arteriosclerosis, contributing to higher blood pressure. The walls of the arteries also tend to accumulate a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaques, which also harden and narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart. The buildup of fatty deposits is called atherosclerosis, and a buildup of plaque in the arteries leading to your heart is known as coronary artery disease and is a major risk factor for heart attack. While not all of the heart and blood vessel changes associated with aging can be controlled, following a healthy diet and getting regular physical activity can almost always help to keep your arteries and heart healthier for longer.Your Brain It’s common for people to experience some slight forgetfulness as they get older, and their ability to process new information or to multitask may slow with age as well, notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, when confusion and memory problems go beyond the occasional “senior moment,” that’s not normal, and you should have it checked out by a medical professional. You could be in the early stages of dementia, but you could also have a treatable condition that’s affecting your brain.Your Digestive System As you age, your digestive tract slows down and doesn't contract as often as it did when you were younger, which can lead to constipation, stomach pain, and feelings of nausea. Many medications also cause or contribute to constipation. To prevent these digestive problems, the Mayo Clinic recommends following a diet that’s rich in fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, keeping as active as possible, and doing your best to manage stress.Your Senses As you age, you may notice that your five senses — hearing, vision, taste, smell, and touch — aren't quite as sharp as they once were, according to Medline Plus. Changes within the structures of the ear may cause you some degree of hearing loss and may also affect your sense of balance. The sharpness of your vision may dull, and you may need reading glasses. You may start to lose your sense of taste, thanks to a decrease in your number of taste buds. Consequently, flavors may not seem as distinct to you, nor as vivid. Your sense of smell may weaken with age due to decreased mucus production and a loss of nerve endings in the nose. You may also find that your sensitivity to touch, pain, pressure, and vibration is reduced — although some people become more sensitive to touch because of thinning skin.Your Teeth and Gums The tough enamel that protects your teeth from decay can start to wear away over the years, leaving you susceptible to cavities. Moreover, per the American Dental Association (ADA), the nerves in your teeth can become smaller with age, leaving you less sensitive to pain and potentially delaying a diagnosis of cavities or cracks in the tooth’s outer surface. And according to an article published in June 2017 in the American Journal of Public Health, more than half of people over age 65 have moderate or severe gum disease; the same article states that around 400 commonly used medications can cause dry mouth, which heightens the risk of oral diseases.Your Skin As you age, your skin loses its elasticity and may start to sag and wrinkle. However, the more you protected your skin from sun damage and smoking when you were younger, the better your skin will look as you get older. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends sunscreen and moisturizer as the two most important anti-aging products you should be using. Wearing a hat with a brim will also protect the skin on your scalp and face. Start protecting your skin now to prevent further damage and to lower your risk of skin cancer.Your Sexual Function After menopause, when menstruation stops and estrogen levels drop, many women experience physical changes, including reduced vaginal lubrication. Per the North American Menopause Society, these changes can also reduce your sex drive. For men, advancing age is often accompanied by erectile dysfunction — though, as the American Sexual Health Association points out, this is not a normal part of aging and may indicate an underlying medical issue or occur as a side effect of a medication. Fortunately, many of these physical issues can be readily treated or, if not, accommodated by open-minded partners who are willing to experiment.While many of these bodily changes are a natural part of aging, they don’t have to slow you down. What’s more, there's a lot you can do to protect your body and keep it as healthy as possible.Editor's PicksHow I Manage Wet AMD: Jeremy’s StoryThis Long Island man is grateful his wet AMD was caught early enough for treatment to help prevent vision loss. Here’s his story.…Learn More10 Steps to Aging Well (and Feeling Great!)Ideally, you’ll have already been practicing healthy habits throughout your life. But even if you haven’t, it's never too late to start taking proactive steps to maintain and even improve your health. Small lifestyle changes can have a big impact, and adopting even a few of the habits listed here will start you on the right track:1. Stay Physically Active for a Healthy Body and MindKeeping physically active can help offset many of the effects of aging. According to Medline Plus, exercising regularly can improve your balance, help keep you mobile, improve your mood by reducing feelings of anxiety and depression, and contribute to better cognitive functioning. It’s also an important part of managing some chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis.Any exercise at all is better than none, says the CDC, which recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like swimming or taking a brisk walk) each week; you can further break this down into 30 active minutes a day for five days a week. It also recommends twice-weekly muscle-strengthening activities. You can find a list of CDC-approved physical activities here. 2. Stay Socially Active With Friends and Family and Within Your CommunityMaking the effort to interact with family and friends can have numerous benefits for your health. One article, published in The Journals of Gerontology, Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences in January 2019, found that participants (all over 65) who reported higher levels of social activity were more likely to experience more positive moods, fewer negative feelings, and higher levels of physical activity.If you don’t currently have an active social life, look for opportunities to reconnect with old friends or make new ones. Seek out like-minded others in church groups, volunteer activities, gyms, alumni groups, or any other group that corresponds to an interest of yours.RELATED: The Healing Power of Friendship Grows With Age3. Follow a Healthy, Well-Balanced DietTo get the nutrition your body needs and lower your risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, make whole foods that are high in fiber and low in saturated fat the foundation of your diet. Following an eating plan like the Mediterranean diet can help you to achieve that goal. The Mediterranean diet emphasizes olive oil, nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fish. It’s low in red meat, full-fat dairy products, and processed foods.4. Don't Neglect Yourself: Schedule Checkups and Stick to ThemRegular checkups with your doctor, dentist, eye doctor, and specialist healthcare providers are opportunities to catch problems early and treat them before they become bigger problems.If you have one or more chronic medical conditions, take multiple medications, are experiencing memory or mobility issues, or have been recently hospitalized, you may want to schedule an appointment with a geriatrician, notes the American Association of Retired Persons. Geriatricians specialize in the care and treatment of older people. Following an initial consultation, they can refer you to other specialists, coordinate care and treatments for health issues, and help you create a care plan tailored to your needs.5. Take All Medication as Directed by Your DoctorIt may seem like a no-brainer, but it bears repeating that you should always take any medication prescribed to you exactly as directed by your doctor (or doctors). However, it’s also worth doing a periodic medication review with your primary care doctor to discuss whether all of your prescriptions are still necessary. The more drugs you take, the harder it can be to remember when and how to take them all, and the higher your risk for adverse (negative) drug reactions as well as drug-drug interactions.While you should almost never stop taking a drug without consulting your doctor first, it can pay to be proactive about reviewing the necessity of all the drugs you’ve been prescribed. And keep in mind that your pharmacist is another resource for information on drugs, drug side effects, and drug interactions.RELATED: The Dangers of Pill Cutting and Skipped Doctor Visits6. Limit Your Alcohol ConsumptionThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines advise that alcohol consumption be limited to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. However, a more recent report, published by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, advises that men limit their alcohol consumption to one drink per day, too.The more recent advice is based on studies that show that the mortality risk associated with drinking alcohol is increased at levels above one drink per day on average for both men and women.7. Quit Smoking to Lower Your Risk of Cancer and Heart DiseaseIf you’re a current smoker, you’ll want to quit as a matter of urgency: According to SmokeFree.gov, the health benefits of quitting smoking include lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate; a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, and lung damage; and stronger bones, muscles, and immune system.8. Get the Sleep That Your Body Needs The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults over 65 get between seven and eight hours of sleep each night. As you age, you may notice that your sleep schedule shifts so that you are sleepier in the early evening and ready to wake earlier in the morning; this is not unusual, nor does it pose an issue so long as you continue to meet the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per night. If you are experiencing chronic or acute insomnia, speak with your doctor, who can help you determine what’s keeping you awake and advise you on possible solutions.9. Practice Good Dental Hygiene Every DayTo protect your teeth and gums, the ADA advises brushing your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush, flossing daily, and regularly cleaning any dentures you may wear. Not only will your teeth and gums be healthier with this routine, but preventing inflammation in your mouth through good dental hygiene can help you manage other chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, according to the American Academy of Periodontology.10. Discuss Changes in Sexual Function With Your DoctorIf you are experiencing changes in your libido or sexual function that are having a negative impact on your sex life, talk to your doctor about it. The National Institute on Aging notes that help is available in the form of physical aids or medication, as well as in communication with your partner and exploring new avenues to physical and emotional intimacy. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a sex therapist, who can help you define what a satisfying sex life would look like for you and how to get there.Warning Signs You Shouldn’t IgnoreIt’s easy to blame a low mood or fatigue on aging, but oftentimes aging is not the direct cause of these woes. Feeling constantly exhausted or depressed is not normal at any age. If you’ve lost the energy or desire to engage in activities you once enjoyed, see your doctor for a checkup. You may be depressed or have another medical problem that needs prompt attention.What are some other warning signs you shouldn’t ignore? Any of the following could indicate a major health problem and should be checked out by a medical professional:Abrupt weakness or dizzinessShortness of breathPressure in your chest areaTingling or numbness, especially on just one side of your bodyLoss of balance or coordinationDifficulty speaking or swallowingExcessive sweatingSudden vision loss or blurred visionMarked swelling, even when you don’t have any recent injuriesRapid weight lossProlonged confusionWounds that never seem to healWith prompt medical attention, many people survive serious medical problems and even thrive afterward if they take it as an opportunity to double down on living healthfully and meaningfully.Additional reporting by Laura McArdle.NEWSLETTERSSign up for our Healthy Living Newsletter!Enter your emailSubscribeBy subscribing you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

It’s also an important part of managing some chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis.Any exercise at all is better than none, says the CDC, which recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (like swimming or taking a brisk walk) each week; you can further break this down into 30 active minutes a day for five days a week. It also recommends twice-weekly muscle-strengthening activities. You can find a list of CDC-approved physical activities here. 2. Stay Socially Active With Friends and Family and Within Your CommunityMaking the effort to interact with family and friends can have numerous benefits for your health. One article, published in The Journals of Gerontology, Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences in January 2019, found that participants (all over 65) who reported higher levels of social activity were more likely to experience more positive moods, fewer negative feelings, and higher levels of physical activity.If you don’t currently have an active social life, look for opportunities to reconnect with old friends or make new ones. Seek out like-minded others in church groups, volunteer activities, gyms, alumni groups, or any other group that corresponds to an interest of yours.RELATED: The Healing Power of Friendship Grows With Age3. Follow a Healthy, Well-Balanced DietTo get the nutrition your body needs and lower your risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, make whole foods that are high in fiber and low in saturated fat the foundation of your diet. Following an eating plan like the Mediterranean diet can help you to achieve that goal. The Mediterranean diet emphasizes olive oil, nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fish. It’s low in red meat, full-fat dairy products, and processed foods.4. Don't Neglect Yourself: Schedule Checkups and Stick to ThemRegular checkups with your doctor, dentist, eye doctor, and specialist healthcare providers are opportunities to catch problems early and treat them before they become bigger problems.If you have one or more chronic medical conditions, take multiple medications, are experiencing memory or mobility issues, or have been recently hospitalized, you may want to schedule an appointment with a geriatrician, notes the American Association of Retired Persons. Geriatricians specialize in the care and treatment of older people. Following an initial consultation, they can refer you to other specialists, coordinate care and treatments for health issues, and help you create a care plan tailored to your needs.5. Take All Medication as Directed by Your DoctorIt may seem like a no-brainer, but it bears repeating that you should always take any medication prescribed to you exactly as directed by your doctor (or doctors). However, it’s also worth doing a periodic medication review with your primary care doctor to discuss whether all of your prescriptions are still necessary. The more drugs you take, the harder it can be to remember when and how to take them all, and the higher your risk for adverse (negative) drug reactions as well as drug-drug interactions.While you should almost never stop taking a drug without consulting your doctor first, it can pay to be proactive about reviewing the necessity of all the drugs you’ve been prescribed. And keep in mind that your pharmacist is another resource for information on drugs, drug side effects, and drug interactions.RELATED: The Dangers of Pill Cutting and Skipped Doctor Visits6. Limit Your Alcohol ConsumptionThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines advise that alcohol consumption be limited to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. However, a more recent report, published by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, advises that men limit their alcohol consumption to one drink per day, too.The more recent advice is based on studies that show that the mortality risk associated with drinking alcohol is increased at levels above one drink per day on average for both men and women.7. Quit Smoking to Lower Your Risk of Cancer and Heart DiseaseIf you’re a current smoker, you’ll want to quit as a matter of urgency: According to SmokeFree.gov, the health benefits of quitting smoking include lower cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate; a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, and lung damage; and stronger bones, muscles, and immune system.8. Get the Sleep That Your Body Needs The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults over 65 get between seven and eight hours of sleep each night. As you age, you may notice that your sleep schedule shifts so that you are sleepier in the early evening and ready to wake earlier in the morning; this is not unusual, nor does it pose an issue so long as you continue to meet the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per night. If you are experiencing chronic or acute insomnia, speak with your doctor, who can help you determine what’s keeping you awake and advise you on possible solutions.9. Practice Good Dental Hygiene Every DayTo protect your teeth and gums, the ADA advises brushing your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush, flossing daily, and regularly cleaning any dentures you may wear. Not only will your teeth and gums be healthier with this routine, but preventing inflammation in your mouth through good dental hygiene can help you manage other chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, according to the American Academy of Periodontology.10. Discuss Changes in Sexual Function With Your DoctorIf you are experiencing changes in your libido or sexual function that are having a negative impact on your sex life, talk to your doctor about it. The National Institute on Aging notes that help is available in the form of physical aids or medication, as well as in communication with your partner and exploring new avenues to physical and emotional intimacy. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a sex therapist, who can help you define what a satisfying sex life would look like for you and how to get there.Warning Signs You Shouldn’t IgnoreIt’s easy to blame a low mood or fatigue on aging, but oftentimes aging is not the direct cause of these woes. Feeling constantly exhausted or depressed is not normal at any age. If you’ve lost the energy or desire to engage in activities you once enjoyed, see your doctor for a checkup. You may be depressed or have another medical problem that needs prompt attention.What are some other warning signs you shouldn’t ignore? Any of the following could indicate a major health problem and should be checked out by a medical professional:Abrupt weakness or dizzinessShortness of breathPressure in your chest areaTingling or numbness, especially on just one side of your bodyLoss of balance or coordinationDifficulty speaking or swallowingExcessive sweatingSudden vision loss or blurred visionMarked swelling, even when you don’t have any recent injuriesRapid weight lossProlonged confusionWounds that never seem to healWith prompt medical attention, many people survive serious medical problems and even thrive afterward if they take it as an opportunity to double down on living healthfully and meaningfully.Additional reporting by Laura McArdle.

4,Article,Physical Fitness,"If you’ve been more focused on your health lately, you’re certainly not alone. An annual survey conducted by Mindbody Wellness Index found that 65% of Americans are paying more attention to their wellness as a result of the pandemic. Yet embracing a healthier lifestyle involves more than making smarter food choices. The true journey to becoming a healthier individual lies in developing routines and habits that will nourish you physically, mentally and spiritually. Here are the steps to take as you embark on a new path. 1. Allow yourself to shift a smidgeWhen we feel bad, mad or sad, it's easy to get stuck there. But simply letting yourself move slightly out of your frame of mind can set you up to be much happier. Gabby Bernstein, motivational speaker and #1 New York Times best-selling author of nine books including her latest Happy Days, suggests reminding yourself that it’s good to feel good. “Now this is not to say that feeling good is easy. We can’t just snap our fingers and go from complete despair to utter joy — nor should we,” she says. “However, if we can learn to find the next-best feeling in any given situation, then that willingness to feel good is enough to keep us in a high vibration.” For example, if you find yourself feeling bored, irritated or overwhelmed, think of a few things that are going well right now (Bernstein plays something she calls The Appreciation Game) or reach out to a friend, colleague, neighbor or family member for support. You might even ask if there’s anything you can do for them, since being of service has been shown to boost the giver’s health and happiness, according to a meta-analysis published in the journal Psychological Bulletin.2. Do some mental yogaPracticing what psychologists call ""cognitive flexibility"" can help manage everyday stressors and irritations, says Sheela Raja, Ph.D., licensed clinical psychologist, associate professor at University of Illinois at Chicago and author of The Resilient Teen. “Cognitive flexibility involves the ability to look at a situation from a lot of different angles,” she says. Let's say you replay a bothersome interaction (perhaps an angry person had a few choice words for you while waiting in line at the grocery store). You feel yourself getting pissed off just thinking about it! Take a deep breath, and do something tactile, like washing your hands in warm water to relax and center yourself. Then try shifting to view it from an angle other than your own. “Think about what might have led them to that point, like their own bad day or some bad news,” she says. “It’s not about always letting people off the hook — it’s about calming your mind and body down enough to know what to do next and how to handle things more mindfully on your end. In turn, this technique builds your empathy for other people, which can help you take things less personally, ultimately decreasing your stress.” 3. Be your own cheerleaderFocusing on positive affirmations (a.k.a. brief uplifting phrases) each day is a ritual that Bernstein says has changed her life. ""Creating a practice of reciting positive affirmations is a transformational way to bring your thoughts, energy and body back to peace,” she writes in Happy Days. Four of her favorite go-to affirmations include, “The Universe has my back,” “I am safe in my body,” “Everything is working out for me” and “I am truly taken care of.” Research has found that affirmations may minimize stress, increase wellbeing, improve academic performance and make people more open to positive behavioral changes, and a study published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience suggested that self affirmations can stimulate areas in the brain that led to decreased sedentary behavior. “You will know an affirmation is ‘right’ for you when it just feels good to say it out loud,” adds Bernstein. Kathrin Ziegler4. Think small when it comes to exercise“Small attainable goals are the best way to establish new habits into your daily routine and motivate yourself to keep going,” says Katie Dunlop, C.P.T., C.S.N., founder & CEO Love Sweat Fitness. She encourages giving yourself 10 minutes a day to do something physically active, whether it’s walking, stretching or doing a short HIIT workout. Then, challenge yourself by making new fitness goals over time. “I spent years trying to stick to extreme workout programs that never stuck and left me feeling worse,” says Dunlop. “But I finally realized the most important thing I could do was just move.” (If you’re looking for an online instructor to keep you motivated, Dunlop offers free daily at-home 10-minute workouts.)GET MOVING24 Best Workout Apps to Try Right Now5. Start with easy stuff that you enjoyIf joining a gym or taking a spinning class feels intimating, don’t do it. Instead, find activities you already like (maybe power walking around your neighborhood or dancing in your living room) and go from there. “I am all for challenging ourselves, but when you’re getting into a new routine and lifestyle, it's all about convenience,” says Dunlop. “If it's not convenient, it won't last.”6. Pretty up your plate“The simplest, most effective way to optimize your health is to include the colors of the rainbow through fruits and vegetables in your weekly food routine,” says Sarah Koszyk, M.A., R.D.N., registered dietitian sports dietitian and author of 25 Anti-Aging Smoothies for Revitalizing, Glowing Skin. She explains that both fruits and veggies are rich in fiber (which fills us up and helps aid in digestion), as well as antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals, all of which support the immune system. Since each vibrant color offers different nutritious benefits, she recommends adding at least one color from a fruit and/or vegetable on your plate at every meal in order to nourish your body. “Perhaps focus on having something red on Monday, orange on Tuesday, yellow on Wednesday, etc., so that over the course of the week, you’ve consumed every color.” TONO BALAGUER7. Eat more omega-3s “Studies have shown omega-3s [a type of fat the body cannot make on its own] can reduce depression and anxiety and improve brain health, while other studies have shown omega-3s reduce the risk of heart disease,” states Koszyk. Plus, these essential fatty acids can also improve eye health, reduce the risk of macular degeneration, reduce inflammation and improve skin health. Eating 4-ounces of fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, tuna and sardines, at least three times a week will provide the essential fats DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), while tossing chia seeds, hemp seeds, ground flax meal, walnuts or edamame into a smoothie, oatmeal, yogurt or salad will offer ALA (alpha-linolenic), the type of “good” fat found in plants. 8. Order! Order in your space!A messy house can stress you out, while organizing your home or office makes for a more calming space and may even be associated with higher activity levels, one study from Indiana University found. Decluttering and getting things in order can also encourage better rest and more productivity, says Raja. “Human beings respond to cues in the environment,” she explains. “If you have a desktop or workspace — even a small one — where things are clean, and the tools you need to do work are readily available (like pens and a laptop), it’s a signal to your mind that it is time to concentrate.” And with more people working from home than ever before, creating a dedicated work zone under your roof is a must. “So no laptop on the couch or on your bed — those zones are for resting.” 9. Go darkIt’s no secret that adequate sleep (which is between seven to nine hours a night, according to the Sleep Foundation) is vital for physical, emotional and mental wellbeing, and now researchers from Northwestern University have recently discovered that ambient lighting could be harming your health. The reason: A moderately lit room during sleep can activate the nervous system and impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation — risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The senior study author advises wearing an eye mask or shutting the curtains (even installing blackout shades) if your bedroom receives too much natural outdoor light. RELATEDHow Much Sleep Do I Really Need?10. Practice mindful eating Say goodbye to eating on-the-go. “Mindful eating includes slowing down as we eat by taking the time to chew thoroughly and savor the flavors of the foods,” explains Koszyk. Eating at a slower pace also allows the brain to receive the “I’m full” message from the stomach, which gives the body a natural solution to controlling portion size. One way to increase mindful eating in your nutrition plan is to enjoy meals without distractions, which means turning off the TV and silencing the phone, says Koszyk. “Also, place the utensils down between bites — yes, this can be hard to do, yet it’s highly effective — to slow down how fast you eat. If you’re dining with others, keep the conversation going so the eating experience lasts longer.” 11. Just move — even if you're not ""exercising""Moving throughout the day, says Dunlop, “is such an important, yet often overlooked, part of starting a healthy routine.” That means looking for ways to sneak in a bit of motion here and there, such as doing squats in the kitchen as you wait for the coffee to brew, stretching your legs as you brush your teeth or making several trips to the car to unload the groceries, rather than trying to do it all in one swoop. “Adding more physical activity into your day will increase endorphins, as well as improve flexibility, mobility and strength,” she continues. Marko Geber12. Cut negative people looseYou might have a few people in your circles that take way more from you emotionally than they offer. Review your support system, suggests Raja. “We need different people for different things — those who give us emotional support, those who are willing to lend a hand and those who are fun to hang out with and bring out the best in us,” she says. If you realize that someone in your circle fails to meet any of these support needs, it might be time to set some new boundaries. “As a result, this could mean decreasing contact with them and eventually letting them go.” This strategy may even add years to your life: One UCLA study found that stressful friendships can increase production of the protein cytokine that causes inflammation, which could increase your chances of being diagnosed with a chronic condition, such as heart disease. “After all, you only get so much time in your life — it’s important to choose who you spend your time with.”13. Have a daily sit-down with yourselfYes, the ancient practice of meditation can do wonders for your mind and body. The numerous benefits that may come from meditating each day, says Bernstein, include reducing stress and anxiety, unleashing creativity and increasing lifespan. Furthermore, the National Institutes of Health reports that meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and flare-ups in people who have been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and help ease insomnia. And it doesn't need to be a big to-do. “Your meditation can be as simple as sitting comfortably with one hand on your heart and another hand on your belly,” explains Bernstein. “If you want to make joy a part of your reality, inhale and say silently to yourself, ‘I am in joy.’ As you breathe out, say, ‘I am at peace.’” She suggests repeating this cycle for at least 10 breaths. (For a guided session, check out her five-minute positive energy meditation.)“By feeling it and envisioning it, you become it.” Related Stories10 Rules for Middle-Age HappinessHow to Be a Better PersonAmy CapettaAmy Capetta has been writing health and lifestyle articles for over 15 years.
